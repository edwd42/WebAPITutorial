Intro to WebAPI
Tim Corey

Learn about WebAPI, a powerful project type that allows C# to communicate with almost any programming language. You can even allow machine to machine communication. So whether you are going to build a mobile app for IOS or Android, a desktop app using WPF, Java, or others, or you are going to build a web application, WebAPI is there to support you.

In this video, I will give you the overview of what WebAPI is, how to set it up, how to connect to it for testing, and then some tips and tricks as well before I show you how to deploy it.
